    <summary>Virtualization</summary>

# üñ•Ô∏è Virtualization in Modern Operating Systems

## üìå What is Virtualization?

Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual instances of computing resources such as hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, or networks. This enables multiple virtual environments‚Äîcalled **virtual machines (VMs)**‚Äîto run concurrently on a single physical system through a **hypervisor** or virtualization layer.

---

## üîë Key Concepts

- **Hypervisor**: A software layer (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, KVM) that manages and runs multiple virtual machines.
- **Guest OS**: The operating system running inside the VM.
- **Host OS**: The physical machine‚Äôs main operating system.

---

## üåü Benefits of Virtualization

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Resource Efficiency**: Run multiple systems on a single machine, optimizing hardware usage.
- üîê **Isolation**: Each VM runs independently, enhancing security and stability.
- üß™ **Testing & Development**: Safely test software without impacting the host system.
- üöö **Portability**: VMs can be easily transferred between machines or platforms.

> In short, virtualization allows one computer to act like many, increasing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Virtualization Works

Virtualization uses a **hypervisor** to create and manage virtual machines. The hypervisor allocates physical resources‚Äîsuch as CPU, memory, and storage‚Äîto each VM, allowing multiple OSes (like Linux, Windows, or Tiny Core) to run simultaneously on one computer.

Each VM behaves like a full standalone computer, running its own applications and OS in complete isolation from others. This setup is particularly useful for:

- Cloud computing environments
- Server consolidation
- Software testing and development
- Network simulations

---

## üß© Components of Virtualization

- üñ•Ô∏è **Host Machine**: The actual physical hardware that provides the computing resources.
- üßæ **Guest Machine**: The virtual machine using those resources.
- üß† **Hypervisor**: The software layer (Type 1 or Type 2) that manages resource allocation and VM operation.

---

## üåê Use Cases

- üîß Software development sandboxes
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- üß™ Penetration testing labs
- üè¢ Enterprise server management

---

Virtualization is a cornerstone of modern computing, enabling better resource utilization, easier software deployment, and secure, isolated environments for a wide range of applications.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Exploring `execve()` System Call in Tiny Core Linux

Tiny Core Linux is a minimal yet powerful Linux distribution, perfect for learning how system calls interact with the kernel. In this README, we dive into the `execve()` system call ‚Äî a fundamental part of process execution in Linux.

---

## üß† What is `execve()`?

The `execve()` system call **replaces the current process image with a new process image**. It is part of the `exec` family (`execl`, `execp`, `execvp`, etc.), but `execve()` is the **lowest-level interface** directly interacting with the kernel.

### üì¶ Function Prototype:

# execve() System Call Example in Tiny Core Linux

This example demonstrates the usage of the `execve()` system call in a Tiny Core Linux environment. The `execve()` function replaces the current process with a new program, in this case, `/bin/echo`.

## üìÑ Code

```c
// execve_example.c
#include <stdio.h>     // for printf(), perror()
#include <unistd.h>    // for execve()
#include <stdlib.h>    // for exit()

int main() {
    // Program to execute
    char *program = "/bin/echo";

    // Arguments (argv): first is the name of the program, then parameters, and NULL-terminated
    char *args[] = { "echo", "Hello from Tiny Core Linux!", NULL };

    // Environment (envp): NULL for default environment
    char *envp[] = { NULL };

    // Execute the program
    if (execve(program, args, envp) == -1) {
        perror("execve failed"); // Print error if execve fails
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return 0; // Will only execute if execve fails
}

int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```
</details>

## üì•‚öôÔ∏èInstallation of Tinycore Linux Operating System
### Downloading the Tiny Core ISO file from the official website is the first step in installing Tiny Core Linux on VirtualBox.  Create a new virtual machine after starting VirtualBox, choose Linux as the operating system type, and set the RAM size to a minimum (e.g., 128MB or more).  To boot into the Tiny Core live environment, connect the downloaded ISO to the virtual CD/DVD drive and turn on the virtual machine.  After booting up, you can use tools like tc-install to install the system to a virtual hard drive and explore the desktop.  Tiny Core Linux operates solely in RAM after setup and reboot, which makes it incredibly quick and light in the virtual machine.
---
## üíª Execve() system call of Tinycore Linux
### The execve() system call in Tiny Core Linux is used to execute a new program, replacing the current process image with a new one. It takes three arguments: the path to the program, an array of argument strings (argv), and an array of environment strings (envp). When execve() is successfully called, the current process is completely replaced by the new program and does not return to the original code. If it fails (e.g., due to a wrong path or insufficient permissions), it returns -1 and sets errno. This system call is essential in Tiny Core Linux for launching programs from low-level C applications or custom shell environments.
